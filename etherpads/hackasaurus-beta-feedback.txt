Hackasaurus Beta Feedback

The in-development beta website is at http://dev.hksr.us and contains links to the latest draft of the Hacktivity Kit and the X-Ray Goggles. Collectively, these are the three main deliverables for the beta release (webpad and hackbook are still in development and won't yet be promoted directly from the website).

If you'd like to help out by filing or fixing bugs, please use our beta release dashboard at http://dash.hksr.us. Otherwise, we'd love to have your feedback on this etherpad--just find the appropriate section below and add your comments or questions there.

Website (General) - 

Goggles- Use the goggles link on the website to try these.
Googles Page
"Install the goggles into your bookmarks bar and use them to remix any web page!" probably needs some explanation of how.

Page  7- When Atul read this, he was caught off-guard because of the size of  the jams- he assumed were small. I think to fix this we should add a  sentence or two- like this: 

While  some hack jams will have only a few learners in attendance, other  events could potentially be larger in scale. This section is to help you  create publicity efforts surrounding a larger scale event.

Page 9- FAQ's

 * For "Isn't hacking bad?" we could provide a pointer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_%28programmer_subculture%29 or a similar page that explains the historical context of the word, etc.

 * For  "What happens when Design Jam participants share their hacked webpages  online?", Atul will give edits to Cristina/Barbara by EOD tuesday. (Atul  should also add a link to the answer in the publish dialog UI itself.)


Pages 10- 13 HTML and CSS Basics-  Atul to give edits to Cristina/ Barbara by EOD Tuesday


Page 23- navigator website url should be: http://navigator.hackasaurus.org, and once they complete the challenge they should be presented w/ a navigator badge.

Where it says - Bust the Hack- (step 5) it should say this instead:

5. HACK- hit the "commit changes" button to save changes locally on your computer


Page 26-  Open up WebPad should have this link: http://webpad.hackasaurus.org/
Hackbook should have this link: http://hackbook.hackasaurus.org/

Question- Hackbook and webpad are in an experimental state, is there  a way to put an asterisk to indicate that these tools are currently being developed?
