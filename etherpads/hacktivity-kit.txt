How this Kit is organized- Jess
 * Reference the About page: http://hackasaurus.org/about/ (eg this paragraph: Hackasaurus spreads skills, attitudes and ethics that help youth thrive  in a remixable digital world. By making it easy for youth to tinker and  mess around with the building blocks that make up the web, Hackasaurus  helps tweens move from digital consumers to active producers, seeing the  web as something they can actively shape, remix and make better.)
 * Use this as a guide
 * Feel free to remix it

 * Explain the 10 steps (in the T.O.C)
